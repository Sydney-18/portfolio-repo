      <p>
        I am a rising junior at Xavier University of Louisiana and majoring in Computer Science and Spanish.
        Computer Science, because I love creating and designing new things. Spanish, because I love languages
        and cultures (I can't wait to learn more about the world)! Once I graduate, I would like to work as a
        User Experience Designer so that I can help people through my visual designs.
      </p>

        I was born and raised in Augusta, Georgia, home of James Brown and The Masters Tournament. However,
        the majority of my family is from Louisiana. My hobbies include traveling, drawing, painting, playing the guitar,
        and watching TV. I also enjoy learning about psychology and personality traits. I'm an INFJ, and like
        to classify myself as an introverted extrovert and a procrastinating perfectionist.
