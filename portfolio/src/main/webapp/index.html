        <cursive>About Me</cursive>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am a rising junior at Xavier University of Louisiana and majoring in Computer Science and Spanish.
        Computer Science, because I love creating and designing new things. Spanish, because I love languages
        and cultures (I can't wait to learn more about the world)! Once I graduate, I would like to work as a
        User Experience Designer so that I can help people through my visual designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Augusta, Georgia, home of James Brown and the Masters Tournament. However,
        the majority of my family is from Louisiana. My hobbies include traveling, drawing, painting, playing the guitar,
        and watching TV. I also enjoy learning about psychology and personality traits. I'm an INFJ, and like
        to classify myself as an introverted extrovert and a procrastinating perfectionist.

        <p>
          During my EP internship, I implemented styling and interaction of a map displaying the geographical
          breakdown of end users. I also worked closely with UX to implement pixel-perfect frontend components
          according to mocks.

      <p>I would love to travel to these cities (and many more) to experience its culture. I personally believe that my life would not be complete withoug immersing myself in places outside my comfort zone. In addition to my love for traveling, I also enjoy taking photos of people, cities, and nature. Capturing a landscape is one of the most beautiful things. Capturing a busy city is even more captivating. I spent my previous summer in New York City, and some of the photos of the city are some of my favourites.</p>

      <p>Although I write with my left hand, I am actually ambidextrous. I do many activities with both hands and can even write with both hands (not very well, but its legible)!</p>
