        <h3>Analytics World Map | UX and Website Design</h3>
        <p>
          During my EP internship, I implemented styling and interaction of a map displaying the geographical
          breakdown of end users. I also worked closely with UX to implement pixel-perfect frontend components
          according to mocks.
